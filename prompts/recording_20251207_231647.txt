residue of forgotten conversations unfolds: 
It is balanced and lyrical, yet gentle and expressive pulses beneath the surface. 
steady, flowing movement guides the eye through mixed contour with both steps and leaps of absence and presence. 
pearlescent ripples on calm water traces left by something that has just departed, opal gentle lanterns at dawn ghosts of forgotten moments, sepia golden dust in the air dissolving into the atmosphere emerge, then dissolve. 
The texture is occasional chords with clear melody, the breath is mixed rhythm with both short and long notes, 
the weight is moderately busy, balanced rhythm, the silence is moderately wide scene. 
optimized impressionist oil painting, soft broken brushstrokes, shimmering light, muted yet rich colors, a whisper rendered visible.
