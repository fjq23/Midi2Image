Imagine a map of faint tremors. 
The atmosphere is balanced and lyrical, charged with gentle and expressive. 
Forms restless, flickering motion through large melodic leaps, fragmented contour of light and shadow. 
Here, sunrise glow, translucent and hovering at the edge of perception — luminous honey-colored highlights dissolving into the atmosphere — spring meadow, crepuscular and like whispers in a half-remembered dream. 
All is occasional chords with clear melody, measured in staccato, percussive motion, 
held in very dense, continuous motion, suspended in wide, cinematic composition. 
optimized impressionist oil painting, soft broken brushstrokes, shimmering light, muted yet rich colors—a poem without language.
