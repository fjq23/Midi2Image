The quality of light just before forgetting: the bottom of a slow river at twilight. 
A deep and melancholic feeling, gentle and expressive in its essence. 
There is a sense of restless, flickering motion, as if something is mixed contour with both steps and leaps. 
The air holds quiet night sky, luminous and traces left by something that has just departed — glowing embers, sepia and as faint stains on old parchment — gauzy pale yellow petals a distant echo of color. 
Everything is occasional chords with clear melody and staccato, percussive motion, very dense, continuous motion and wide, cinematic composition. 
optimized impressionist oil painting, soft broken brushstrokes, shimmering light, muted yet rich colors—no words, only the residue of meaning.
