the bottom of a slow river at twilight unfolds: 
It is deep and melancholic, yet gentle and expressive pulses beneath the surface. 
steady, flowing movement guides the eye through mixed contour with both steps and leaps of absence and presence. 
dramatic red fabric, weathered and as faint stains on old parchment, ripples on calm water, luminous and like whispers in a half-remembered dream, gilded soft golden light a distant echo of color emerge, then dissolve. 
The texture is occasional chords with clear melody, the breath is mixed rhythm with both short and long notes, 
the weight is moderately busy, balanced rhythm, the silence is moderately wide scene. 
high quality CG 3D rendering, detailed modeling, physically based lighting, crisp edges, realistic materials, a whisper rendered visible.
