the architecture of silence. A balanced and lyrical feeling, gentle and expressive in its essence. There is a sense of steady, flowing movement, as if something is large melodic leaps, fragmented contour. The air holds weathered quiet night sky barely-there suggestions of form; faint sparks in the dark, crepuscular and like ripples in a half-remembered memory. Everything is occasional chords with clear melody and mixed rhythm with both short and long notes, moderately busy, balanced rhythm and wide, cinematic composition. optimized impressionist oil painting, soft broken brushstrokes, shimmering light, muted yet rich colors—no words, only the residue of meaning. No text, no logos, no people.
