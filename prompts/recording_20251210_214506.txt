Imagine the bottom of a slow river at twilight. 
The atmosphere is deep and melancholic, charged with gentle and expressive. 
Forms steady, flowing movement through large melodic leaps, fragmented contour of light and shadow. 
Here, sunrise glow, crepuscular and as faint stains on old parchment; moss on old stones, luminous and dissolving into the atmosphere; amber reflections, weathered and hovering at the edge of perception. 
All is occasional chords with clear melody, measured in mixed rhythm with both short and long notes, 
held in moderately busy, balanced rhythm, suspended in wide, cinematic composition. 
Van Gogh brushwork style, thick impasto strokes, swirling motion, vibrant contrasting colors—a poem without language.
