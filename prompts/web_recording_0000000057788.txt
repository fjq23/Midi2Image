the ghost of a gesture. 
A balanced and lyrical feeling, gentle and expressive in its essence. 
There is a sense of steady, flowing movement, as if something is large melodic leaps, fragmented contour. 
The air holds diffuse amber reflections a distant echo of color, crepuscular clear blue water as faint stains on old parchment, pale yellow petals, gilded and hovering at the edge of perception. 
Everything is rich, layered chords and harmonies and mixed rhythm with both short and long notes, moderately busy, balanced rhythm and wide, cinematic composition. 
optimized impressionist oil painting, soft broken brushstrokes, shimmering light, muted yet rich colors—no words, only the residue of meaning.
