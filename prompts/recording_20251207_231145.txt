A dimly lit forest floor built from invisible rhythms and structures. The scene feels gentle and expressive and deep and melancholic, with steady, flowing movement. Color and light appear as soft golden light in the background; lake reflecting the sky scattered across the ground; moss on old stones in the background. Underlying structure: occasional chords with clear melody, mixed rhythm with both short and long notes, moderately busy, balanced rhythm, large melodic leaps, fragmented contour. wide, cinematic composition, highly detailed illustration, ultra-detailed, no text.
