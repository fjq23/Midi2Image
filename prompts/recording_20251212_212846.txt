residue of forgotten conversations unfolds: 
It is balanced and lyrical, yet gentle and expressive pulses beneath the surface. 
steady, flowing movement guides the eye through large melodic leaps, fragmented contour of absence and presence. 
veiled tiny sprouts of grass like whispers in a half-remembered dream, fractured sunrise glow traces left by something that has just departed emerge, then dissolve. 
The texture is occasional chords with clear melody, the breath is mixed rhythm with both short and long notes, 
the weight is moderately busy, balanced rhythm, the silence is wide, cinematic composition. 
Van Gogh brushwork style, thick impasto strokes, swirling motion, vibrant contrasting colors, a whisper rendered visible.
