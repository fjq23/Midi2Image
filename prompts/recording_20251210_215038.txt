A misty valley landscape built from invisible rhythms and structures. The scene feels gentle and expressive and deep and melancholic, with steady, flowing movement. Color and light appear as glowing embers gently surrounding the subject; distant mountains glowing along the edges of the frame; gentle lanterns at dawn glowing along the edges of the frame. Underlying structure: occasional chords with clear melody, mixed rhythm with both short and long notes, moderately busy, balanced rhythm, large melodic leaps, fragmented contour. wide, cinematic composition, dreamlike atmospheric scene, ultra-detailed, no text.
