a map of faint tremors. 
A balanced and lyrical feeling, gentle and expressive in its essence. 
There is a sense of steady, flowing movement, as if something is mixed contour with both steps and leaps. 
The air holds blue-violet haze, radiant and dissolving into the atmosphere — weathered vivid neon accents as faint stains on old parchment. 
Everything is occasional chords with clear melody and mixed rhythm with both short and long notes, moderately busy, balanced rhythm and wide, cinematic composition. 
divine, pure photography style, soft natural light, high dynamic range, minimal noise, cinematic composition—no words, only the residue of meaning.
