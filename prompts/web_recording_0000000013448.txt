the bottom of a slow river at twilight unfolds: 
It is deep and melancholic, yet gentle and expressive pulses beneath the surface. 
steady, flowing movement guides the eye through large melodic leaps, fragmented contour of absence and presence. 
moss on old stones, crepuscular and ghosts of forgotten moments, open sky horizon, pearlescent and hovering at the edge of perception, a few white doves gliding in the distance, ash and barely-there suggestions of form emerge, then dissolve. 
The texture is occasional chords with clear melody, the breath is mixed rhythm with both short and long notes, 
the weight is very dense, continuous motion, the silence is wide, cinematic composition. 
optimized impressionist oil painting, soft broken brushstrokes, shimmering light, muted yet rich colors, a whisper rendered visible.
