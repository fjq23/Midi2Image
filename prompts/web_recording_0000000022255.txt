the ghost of a gesture unfolds: 
It is balanced and lyrical, yet gentle and expressive pulses beneath the surface. 
steady, flowing movement guides the eye through large melodic leaps, fragmented contour of absence and presence. 
soft golden light, translucent and a distant echo of color, veiled gentle ocean waves a distant echo of color emerge, then dissolve. 
The texture is occasional chords with clear melody, the breath is mixed rhythm with both short and long notes, 
the weight is very dense, continuous motion, the silence is wide, cinematic composition. 
Van Gogh brushwork style, thick impasto strokes, swirling motion, vibrant contrasting colors, a whisper rendered visible.
