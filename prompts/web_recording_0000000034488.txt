Imagine residue of forgotten conversations. 
The atmosphere is balanced and lyrical, charged with gentle and expressive. 
Forms steady, flowing movement through large melodic leaps, fragmented contour of light and shadow. 
Here, translucent ruby reflections ghosts of forgotten moments, opal moss on old stones a distant echo of color. 
All is occasional chords with clear melody, measured in mixed rhythm with both short and long notes, 
held in very dense, continuous motion, suspended in wide, cinematic composition. 
optimized impressionist oil painting, soft broken brushstrokes, shimmering light, muted yet rich colors—a poem without language.
