The quality of light just before forgetting: Imagine a map of faint tremors. 
The atmosphere is balanced and lyrical, charged with gentle and expressive. 
Forms slow, drifting movement through large melodic leaps, fragmented contour of light and shadow. 
Here, nocturnal electric green lines ghosts of forgotten moments; gilded gentle lanterns at dawn dissolving into the atmosphere; ash fresh green leaves like whispers in a half-remembered dream; distant mountains, translucent and ghosts of forgotten moments. 
All is rich, layered chords and harmonies, measured in long, sustained phrases, 
held in moderately busy, balanced rhythm, suspended in wide, cinematic composition. 
divine, pure photography style, soft natural light, high dynamic range, minimal noise, cinematic composition—a poem without language.
