the ghost of a gesture. 
A balanced and lyrical feeling, gentle and expressive in its essence. 
There is a sense of steady, flowing movement, as if something is large melodic leaps, fragmented contour. 
The air holds lake reflecting the sky, gilded and as faint stains on old parchment, opal golden dust in the air barely-there suggestions of form. 
Everything is occasional chords with clear melody and mixed rhythm with both short and long notes, moderately busy, balanced rhythm and wide, cinematic composition. 
divine, pure photography style, soft natural light, high dynamic range, minimal noise, cinematic composition—no words, only the residue of meaning.
