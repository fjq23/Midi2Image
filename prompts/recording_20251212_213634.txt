a map of faint tremors. 
A balanced and lyrical feeling, gentle and expressive in its essence. 
There is a sense of steady, flowing movement, as if something is large melodic leaps, fragmented contour. 
The air holds a few white doves gliding in the distance, nocturnal and traces left by something that has just departed, translucent a slow drift of maple leaves in the air ghosts of forgotten moments, embossed honey-colored highlights barely-there suggestions of form. 
Everything is occasional chords with clear melody and mixed rhythm with both short and long notes, moderately busy, balanced rhythm and moderately wide scene. 
optimized impressionist oil painting, soft broken brushstrokes, shimmering light, muted yet rich colors—no words, only the residue of meaning.
