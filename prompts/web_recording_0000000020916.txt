a map of faint tremors. 
A calm and introspective feeling, gentle and expressive in its essence. 
There is a sense of slow, drifting movement, as if something is large melodic leaps, fragmented contour. 
The air holds fractured sunrise glow like whispers in a half-remembered dream; late afternoon sunlight, sepia and ghosts of forgotten moments; lake reflecting the sky, opal and dissolving into the atmosphere. 
Everything is occasional chords with clear melody and long, sustained phrases, moderately busy, balanced rhythm and wide, cinematic composition. 
optimized impressionist oil painting, soft broken brushstrokes, shimmering light, muted yet rich colors—no words, only the residue of meaning.
