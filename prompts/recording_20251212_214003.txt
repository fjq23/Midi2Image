Imagine residue of forgotten conversations. 
The atmosphere is balanced and lyrical, charged with gentle and expressive. 
Forms steady, flowing movement through large melodic leaps, fragmented contour of light and shadow. 
Here, gentle lanterns at dawn, pearlescent and hovering at the edge of perception — smudged open sky horizon traces left by something that has just departed. 
All is occasional chords with clear melody, measured in mixed rhythm with both short and long notes, 
held in very dense, continuous motion, suspended in wide, cinematic composition. 
optimized impressionist oil painting, soft broken brushstrokes, shimmering light, muted yet rich colors—a poem without language.
