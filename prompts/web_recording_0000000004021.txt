Imagine a chamber of amber light. 
The atmosphere is deep and melancholic, charged with gentle and expressive. 
Forms restless, flickering motion through mixed contour with both steps and leaps of light and shadow. 
Here, diffuse lake reflecting the sky hovering at the edge of perception; warm candlelight, nocturnal and hovering at the edge of perception; luminous warm wooden textures like whispers in a half-remembered dream. 
All is occasional chords with clear melody, measured in staccato, percussive motion, 
held in very dense, continuous motion, suspended in moderately wide scene. 
Van Gogh brushwork style, thick impasto strokes, swirling motion, vibrant contrasting colors—a poem without language.
