A pause that becomes a landscape: the architecture of silence unfolds: 
It is balanced and lyrical, yet gentle and expressive pulses beneath the surface. 
restless, flickering motion guides the eye through large melodic leaps, fragmented contour of absence and presence. 
nocturnal dramatic red fabric a distant echo of color; opal ripples on calm water traces left by something that has just departed emerge, then dissolve. 
The texture is occasional chords with clear melody, the breath is staccato, percussive motion, 
the weight is very dense, continuous motion, the silence is wide, cinematic composition. 
optimized impressionist oil painting, soft broken brushstrokes, shimmering light, muted yet rich colors, a whisper rendered visible.
